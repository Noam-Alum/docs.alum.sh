# Compress directory

[After the SQL file is generated](Export-database.html) you are asked if you wish to compress the current website directory (to prepare for a migration).

If you answer Y you are prompted with the commands the script wants to run and asked whether or not you allow them to run based on your judgment.

If you allow the script to run the commands you are given the new **tar.gz** file with a file named with random characters and numbers to make it less accessible to the outside world.

```sh
Continue? [Y/N] : Y
This can take a while... Please dont exit.
